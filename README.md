## Description

This script will convert a Spotify playlist into a Youtube Music playlist. This script uses the [ytmusicapi](https://pypi.org/project/ytmusicapi/) library, which allows the script to run as the Youtube API is too limited and throttled.

# Getting started

Run main.py and insert the public spotify URL. The script requires a *headers_auth.json* file in the root directory. More info on this can be found [here](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html#authenticated). This script uses the manual json file load.
